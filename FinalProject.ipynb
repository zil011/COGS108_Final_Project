    "In order to see whether or not there is a significant correlation between the weather and the number of rides made per day in New York, appropriate data has been gathered and analyzed. The weather is divided into three different attributes; temperature, wind speed, and humidity, for each hour during the day in May of 2014. These three attributes were analyzed against the number of rides made in each month, to see if we can visually see the correlation between these three attributes and the rides made."

    "There were no prior Work done for our topic. But based on our experiences with acquiring rides in certain weather conditions, there are numerous reasons why one can consider getting a taxi/Uber compared to getting there by foot or other means. One of the main components that influences this decision is weather. Engineers in the New York State created a system to provide information about the road conditions in New York State, specifically catering towards the more haphazard winter season, providing whether the highway will be blocked or not due to snow and ice operations. They also included a report for each of the observed years to include a more detailed description of the road conditions and list how accurate their report was. But not much of these affected the road conditions during the non-winter seasons. Whether it's the wind travel advisory warnings, slippery driveways on a rainy day, drivers and the riders tend to be more wary of the environmental situations around the road regardless of the season, which affects their decision to get a ride or not, conclusively affecting the number of rides that are made in New York. In order to investigate this information, we decided to use our readily available public data to analyze and infer to the possible correlations listed in our research question and hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "We predict that these factor will correlate to the number of rides in some way. It is harder to say whether it will be a negative or positive correlation because unfavorable weather conditions can include either extremely low temperatures or extremely high temperatures. However, we predict ride counts to be higher on days with unfavorable weather conditions, such as thunderstorm or rain. For instance, if for a particular hour, the wind speed, humidity, and temperature are all relatively higher compared to the whole dataset, we predict the ride count to be higher as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that unfavorable weather conditions will lead to higher ride counts because people are less willing to walk or take public transportation in those conidtions. For example, if the weather was nice and sunny, people are more willing to save money and walk a couple of blocks. However, if it was rainy and cold, there is a higher chance of people getting a ride so that they can stay dry and warm. "

    "The data set we are analyzing for this project is public data obtained from an open source. The data on its own does not reveal any private information about individual users as well as Uber drivers so we are not as concerned with personal privacy. However, analyzers could still easily extract a lot of information from these data. For instance, analyzing this data set could reveal users’ commute patterns and preferences. Though this does not point to a specific person, it could be information that could be sold to other companies for profit. From this, companies can target users based on their individual preferences. For example, they could distribute advertisements based on these preferences. Or, rideshare apps, like Uber, could take advantage of all these data and deliberately raise prices when the demand is high. "
