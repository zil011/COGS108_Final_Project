    "Based on our experiences with Uber, the price for riders can vary drastically with no clear indications as to why. According to the FiveThirtyEight article, “Is Uber making NYC Rush Hour Traffic Worse?”, there is an increase in Uber demand during rush hour, which could contribute to the fluctuation in price. Instead of making assumptions based on an educated guess, we decided to look into their website and look for any public information about it.\n",
    "In Uber’s official website, general information about this fluctuation in price was provided only for the Uber drivers. Labeled as surge price, fare calculation and its system are shown and explained for Uber drivers.  (Here’s the link). Although the website is public and both parties, including riders and drivers, the separate section for riders did not include information about surge pricing and that might be one of the reasons why most of the riders are unaware of its existence and how it works until the Uber app alerts of the sudden price change.\n",
    "As we mentioned in our question and hypothesis section, surge prices are calculated based on location and time during the day. According to the website, the surge pricing is determined by two combined factors; the rider’s location as well as the real-time demand by the riders in the same specific area. Depending on Uber’s jurisdiction on these specific areas, riders are charged with fixed rates of either 1.8x or 2.5x, which is multiplied on the already existing base ride fare. These multipliers are also bound by specific locations. Certain locations have 2.5 multiplication rate while others have a different rate or no rate at all. Although Uber has a specific map inside the app that shows the multiplier rate in the current and nearby area, they did not get into details on how the jurisdiction is made to each individual area and how the rates are justified. In order to investigate this information, we decided to use our readily available public data to analyze and infer to the possible correlations listed in our hypothesis.\n",

    "The data set we are analyzing for this project is public data obtained from an open source. The data on its own does not reveal any private information about individual users as well as Uber drivers so we are not as concerned with personal privacy. However, analyzers could still easily extract a lot of information from these data. For instance, analyzing this data set could reveal users’ commute patterns and preferences. Though this does not point to a specific person, it could be information that could be sold to other companies for profit. From this, companies can target users based on their individual preferences. For example, they could distribute advertisements based on these preferences. Or, rideshare apps, like Uber, could take advantage of all these data and deliberately raise prices when the demand is high. "
